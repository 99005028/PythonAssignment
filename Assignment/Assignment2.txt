2. Correct the malformed date string, for e.g. "45/8/2018" to "14/9/2018"
.

3. Convert ip address from "a.b.c.d" format into integer and vice versa.


4. Check whether given string is isogram or not.
n=input()
k=0
for i in n:
  if n.count(i)>1:
    print("Not an isogram")
    k=1
    break
if(k==0):
  print("isogram")

5. Given a string, find the mexican wave.
n="hello"
a=n

for i in range(len(n)):
  print(n[0:i]+a[i:i+1]+n[i+1:len(n)])
  
6. Given a number, find the largest number by deleting single digit (order of digits will remain same).


7. Given a number, find the largest number by shuffling the digits.
n=int(input())
a=[]
x=""
n=str(n)
for i in range(len(n)):
  a.append(n[i])
a.sort(reverse=True)
for i in a:
  x=x+i
print(x)


8. Compute the word frequency in given message.
n="""Where firstprog.py is the name of the file containing your Python program. Make sure to use the cd command to be in the correct directory that contains your program file(s).
You can run your program over and over again in the command window. Hint: You can use the up-arrow key to scroll back through previous commands and re-execute them by pressing enter. This allows you to quickly edit and rerun your program to make and test changes."""
a=input()
x=n.count(a)
print(a+"  "+str(x))
